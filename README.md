REST API to handle multiple device end-point sync
Task
Your task will be to build a back-end infrastructure to handle multiple end-points. A user may access his/her Fitbod account through iPhone, iPad, iPod, and/or web interface. When workouts are logged and modified at one end-point, the change should be reflected on other devices.

Then please write RESTful API services that will process incoming requests from the devices/users to save and receive workout information. Provide documentation on how this api should be used via a README.md in the root directory.

Please write a simple front-end admin web interface that will allow us to view a list of workouts in a given userâ€™s workout history. We should also be able to save new workouts and modify the existing workout duration.
